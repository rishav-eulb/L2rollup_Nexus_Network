## Problem Faced and Solutions Implemented

### Part 1:

1. **Memory Space Efficiency:**
   - Due to limited space in the root hard drive, I needed to prioritize memory space efficiency.
   
2. **Installing direnv Package:**
   - Initially, I encountered difficulties installing the direnv package. However, I overcame this obstacle by practicing Linux commands and referring to the official documentation on direnv.
   
3. **Time Efficiency in Deployment:**
   - Deploying the L1 contracts essential for the chain's functionality required time efficiency. During peak times, the estimated amount of ETH required was notably higher, approximately $10k if executed on the mainnet.
   
4. **Optimistic Rollup Documentation:**
   - The official documentation of Optimistic Rollup lacked clarity regarding running op-geth, op-node, batchr, proposer concurrently.

### Part 2:

1. **Finding Specific Documentation:**
   - I encountered challenges in locating specific documentation required to complete Part 2. To address this, I utilized OpenAI and Gemini AI to better understand the concepts involved.
   
2. **Costlier Strategy on Mainnet:**
   - Experimented with a strategy that proved to be costlier on the mainnet. This involved transferring tokens from L1StandardBridge to L2StandardBridge and implementing a function (intiatingETHtoken()) that iterated n times on a custom function to bridge tokens.
   
3. **Configuration for Event Capture:**
   - I wasn't able to determine whether I needed to implement a mechanism to capture events emitted from the Optimism portal.
